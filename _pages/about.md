I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in asset pricing, macroeconomics and international finance.

Previously, I was a research assistant at New York University. Before that, I worked at BlackRock in New York. I studied mathematics and economics at Georgetown University, where I was also a member of the NCAA Division I swim team.
