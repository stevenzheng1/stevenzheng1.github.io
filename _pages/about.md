I'm a PhD student at Columbia Business School and visiting Copenhagen Business School in summer 2023. My research interests are in asset pricing and macro-finance.

Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with Yuriy Gorodnichenko and competed on the triathlon team. Before that, I worked as a research assistant at New York University and at BlackRock in New York. I studied mathematics and economics at Georgetown University, where I was also on the NCAA Division I swim team.
