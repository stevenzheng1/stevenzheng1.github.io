I'm a PhD student at Columbia Business School. My research interests are in asset pricing and macro-finance.

Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley and competed on Cal's triathlon team. Before that, I was a research assistant at New York University and worked at BlackRock in New York. I studied mathematics and economics at Georgetown University, where I was also on the NCAA Division I swim team.
