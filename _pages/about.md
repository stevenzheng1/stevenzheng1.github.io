I'm a research assistant at New York University. My research interests are in asset pricing, macroeconomics and international finance.

Previously, I worked at BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. I studied mathematics and economics at Georgetown University, where I was also a member of the NCAA Division I swim team.
